I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/">Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies</a> at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.mingmingfan.com/">Fan Mingming</a> and Prof. <a href="http://huamin.org/">Qu Huamin</a>. My current research focuses on developing and applying computational methods—such as cognitive modeling and machine learning—to understand and enhance human adaptive learning behaviors.

My work advances <b>adaptive learning systems</b> in two key directions: (1) leveraging human-centered design and emerging technologies—such as augmented reality (AR)—to create interactive support mechanisms that provide multi-modal, context-aware assistance, and (2) applying cognitive science and machine learning to differentiate cognitive load types and model trial-and-error learning strategies through <b>reinforcement learning</b>, enabling systems to provide human-like adaptive assistance. By integrating <b>cognitive modeling</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, and <b>interactive system design</b>, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications, creating technologies that adapt seamlessly to users’ cognitive states and learning needs. Beyond my core research, I am actively involved in <b>AI-assisted healthcare</b>, <b>large language model (LLM)-supported accessibility</b> for blind and low-vision (BLV) users, and the intersection of AI with computational media arts.

Currently, I am a visiting Ph.D. student at Prof. <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~oulasvir/">Antti Oulasvirta’s</a> <a href="https://cbl.aalto.fi/">Computational Behavior Lab</a>  at Aalto University, Finland. Prior to this, I have been worked as a machine learning engienner in Baidu and deep learning researcher in Deepir, led by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/stevenhoi/home">Steven Hoi</a>. My work is driven by a passion for leveraging AI to uncover human nature and address pressing social challenges and contribute to a healthier, more inclusive society.
