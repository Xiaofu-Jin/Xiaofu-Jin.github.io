<b>Greetings!</b>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/"> Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies</a>  at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am also a Program Committee member of <a href="https://chi2024.acm.org/">CHI</a>, <a href="http://chchi2021.icachi.org/">ChineseCHI</a> Late-breaking Work track. My research interests are the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence in the healthy aging and healthcare domain. Recently, I will delve deeper into computational cognitive modeling to figure out people's learning processes. Additionally, I am interested in leveraging AI in computational media arts and have been working on the artwork/research of <i><b>Pet Capitalism</b></i>. ( I have two adorable cats, and it deeply saddens me that many pets consume substandard pet food produced by individuals primarily motivated by profit. )

I am passionate about exploring the boundaries of human experience and am eager to tackle challenging social issues. My goal is to uncover underlying concepts through computational models or art to create meaningful impacts. If my work resonates with you or you’d like to connect, please feel free to reach out via email! <b><span style="color:red;">I am now looking for a post-doc position!</span></b>
