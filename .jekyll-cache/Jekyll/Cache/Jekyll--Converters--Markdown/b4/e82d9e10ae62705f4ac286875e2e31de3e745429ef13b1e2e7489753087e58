I"ù<p><b>Greetings!</b></p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/"> Academy of Interdiscriplinary Studies</a>  at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am also a Program Committee member of <a href="http://chchi2021.icachi.org/">ChineseCHI</a> Late-breaking Work track. My research interests are the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence in healthy aging and healthcare domain. Additionally, I am interested in leveraging AI in computational media arts. Recently, I have been working on projects about <em><b>support older adults to learn digital technologies </b></em> , <em><b>support at-home health care, predetection of diseases</b></em> and artwork/research on <i><b>Pet Capitalism</b></i>. (I raised two cute cats~)</p>

<p>I enjoy exploring human boundaries and would love to contribute to solving serious social problems either by exploiting technologies or revealing underlying concepts in the form of art to make an impact. If you are interested in my work or would like to get connected, please don‚Äôt hesitate to send me an e-mail!</p>
